## üìòIntroduction

### Web Application Basics - Introduction Summary
- The room introduces fundamental components of web applications.
- Focus areas include:
	- URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
	- HTTP requests
	- HTTP responses
- It is designed for:
	- Beginners seeking foundational knowledge
	- Individuals planning to build or interact with web applications


## üìòWeb Application Overview
### Web Application Basics - Planet Analogy & Web Components
- A web application is likened to a planet:
	- **Astronauts** = users with web browsers
	- **Planet surface** = what users see and interact with (Front End)
	- **Beneath the surface** = the unseen but essential systems (Back End)

### Front End
- The Front End is the **visible** part of a web application, like the surface of a planet.
- Technologies used:
	- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:
		- Provides structure and content
		- Like DNA of basic organisms it defines layout and presence
	- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
        - Adds visual styling (colour, layout, font)
        - Like cosmetic traits in DNA, it controls appearance
    - **JavaScript (JS)**:
        - Adds interactivity and logic to a web page
        - Like a brain that makes decisions based on interaction

### Back End
- The Back End handles everything **behind the scenes**, it's not visible to users but vital.
- Components:
    - **Database**:
        - Stores, retrieves, and modifies information (e.g., user preferences)
        - Like maps, diaries, libraries, organised information storage
    - **Infrastructure**:
        - Includes servers, networking, and systems that keep things running
        - Comparable to roads, cars, and fuel on a planet
    - **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**:
        - Optional but important for security
        - Acts like a planet‚Äôs protective atmosphere, it filters harmful traffic

### Summary
- **Front End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create the user experience in the browser.
- **Back End**: Web servers, databases, infrastructure, and WAFs power the application behind the scenes.
- This foundational overview sets the stage for deeper learning in future sections.

### ‚ùì Question 1 - Which component on a computer is responsible for hosting and delivering content for web applications?
#### üß™ Process
Try not to think of `computer` as the _local_ client and rather a compute unit generally. 

So the component responsible for hosting a web application on a compute engine would be a `web server`.

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer 1
- `web server` ‚úÖ
### ‚ùì Question 2 - Which tool is used to access and interact with web applications?
#### üß™ Process
Generally you would interact with a web site with a `web browser`. 

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer 2
- `web browser` ‚úÖ
### ‚ùì Question 3 - Which component acts as a protective layer, filtering incoming traffic to block malicious attacks, and ensuring the security of the the web application?
#### üß™ Process
This would be a firewall. Specifically a `web application firewall`.

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer 3
- `Web Application Firewall` ‚úÖ
