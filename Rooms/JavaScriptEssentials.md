## üìòIntroduction
### JavaScript Essentials
- JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language used to add interactivity to websites built with HTML and CSS.
- It enables features like form validation, animations, and button click actions.
- JS is often used in tandem with HTML and is just as important as HTML and CSS in web development.
- This room serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to JS, focusing on:
	- Fundamental JS concepts
	- How attackers can abuse legitimate JS features for malicious purposes
- **Prerequisites:**
	- ‚ùì[Linux Fundamentals Module](LinuxFundamentalsModule.md)
	- ‚úÖ[Web Application Basics](WebApplicationBasics.md)
	- ‚ùì[How Websites Work](HowWebsitesWork.md)
- **Learning Objectives:**
	- Learn core JavaScript concepts
	- Understand how to embed JS into HTML
	- Explore misuse of JS dialog functions
	- Discover how to bypass control flow logic
	- Analyse and understand minified JS files


## üìòEssential Concepts
### Variables, Functions & Control Flow
- **Variables** are containers used to store data. Each variable has a name to allow easy reference later.
	- There are **three main ways to declare variables in JS**:
		- `var`: function-scoped
		- `let`: block-scoped
		- `const`: block-scoped, and cannot be reassigned
	- **Data Types** in JS include:
		- `string` ‚Äì text (e.g., "hello")
		- `number` ‚Äì numeric values (e.g., 42)
		- `boolean` ‚Äì true/false values
		- `null` ‚Äì an intentional absence of value
		- `undefined` ‚Äì a variable declared but not assigned
		- `object` ‚Äì used for complex structures like arrays or key-value pairs
	- **Functions** group reusable blocks of code to perform a specific task.
		- Example: `PrintResult(rollNum)` displays a student's result based on roll number.
		- Functions accept parameters and help avoid code repetition.
			``` javascript
			javascriptfunction PrintResult(rollNum) {
				alert("Username with roll number " + rollNum + " has passed the exam");
				}
			```
    - **Loops** are used to repeat a task as long as a condition is met.
	    - Common loop types: `for`, `while`, `do...while`
	    - Ideal for iterating over arrays or repeating logic without duplicating code.
	    ```javascript
	    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	        PrintResult(rollNumbers[i]);
	    }
	    ```
	- **Request-Response Cycle** describes the interaction between a client (browser) and a server:
		- The client sends a **request** (e.g., clicking a link or submitting a form)
		- The server sends a **response** (e.g., an HTML page, JSON data, or error code)

### ‚ùì Question 1
> What term allows you to run a code block multiple times as long as it is¬†a condition?
#### üß™ Process
It's a loop, you would loop through a block of code multiple times until a condition is met.
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `loop`


## üìòJavaScript Overview
### Writing our first JavaScript program
- **JavaScript is an interpreted language**, meaning it runs directly in the browser without needing compilation.
- The first sample program introduces several foundational concepts:
    ```javascript
    // Hello, World! program
    console.log("Hello, World!");
    
    // Variable and Data Type
    let age = 25;
    
    // Control Flow Statement
    if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("You are an adult.");
    } else {
        console.log("You are a minor.");
    }
    
    // Function
    function greet(name) {
        console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
    
    // Calling the function
    greet("Bob");
    ```
- **Concepts demonstrated:**
	- Logging output with `console.log`
	- Defining variables (`let age = 25`)
	- Using conditional statements (`if...else`)
	- Creating and invoking functions
- **Client-side Execution:**
	- JavaScript primarily runs in the browser, making it easy to interact with and inspect via developer tools.
- **Running JavaScript in Chrome Console:**
	- Launch Google Chrome from the VM Desktop.
	- Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` or right-click and choose **Inspect**.
	- Navigate to the **Console** tab to begin writing JavaScript directly.
- **Example: Adding Two Numbers in Console**
    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let result = x + y;
    console.log("The result is: " + result);
    ```
    - Paste the code into the Console with `Ctrl + V`, then press `Enter`.
    - You should see: `The result is: 15`

### ‚ùì Question 1
> What is the code output if the value of x is changed to 10?
#### üß™ Process
I don't need to run the app to see that if you change `5 + 10 = 15` to 10 + 10 the answer would change to 20

The output would then be `The result is: 20`

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `The result is: 20` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 2
> Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language?
#### üß™ Process
This is the first line, it is not compiled as it is run as it is. So you don't use a compiler to generate a binary. Therefore it is an interpreted language.

Trying this as my answer.
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `interpreted` ‚úÖ



## üìòIntegrating JavaScript in HTML
### Integrating JavaScript
- JavaScript is used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic, interactive websites.
- JavaScript does not render content by itself, it manipulates and enhances what‚Äôs already defined in HTML.
- **Two primary methods to integrate JavaScript into HTML:**
	- **Internal JavaScript**
	- **External JavaScript**

#### Internal JavaScript
- Internal JS is written **within** the HTML file using `<script>` tags.
- It can be placed in the `<head>` (loaded before content) or `<body>` (executed with content).
- Ideal for beginners and small projects.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Internal JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Addition of Two Numbers</h1>
    <p id="result"></p>

    <script>
        let x = 5;
        let y = 10;
        let result = x + y;
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The result is: " + result;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
- This script:
	- Declares two variables
	- Adds them
	- Updates the `<p>` element with the result using `document.getElementById().innerHTML`
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614095443.png)

#### External JavaScript
- External JS separates the script from HTML for **better readability and maintainability**.
- The JS code is stored in a `.js` file and loaded into HTML via the `src` attribute in the `<script>` tag.
**Example:**
1. Create `script.js` and save file on the Desktop
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let result = x + y;
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The result is: " + result;
```
2. Create `external.html` and save file on the Desktop
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>External JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Addition of Two Numbers</h1>
    <p id="result"></p>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
- The output is the **same** as the internal version, but the JS logic is now cleanly separated.
	![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614095912.png)

#### Verifying Internal vs. External JavaScript
- Right-click on a webpage and choose **View Page Source** in Chrome.
	- **Internal JS**: Code appears between `<script>` tags _without_ a `src` attribute.
	- **External JS**: `<script>` tag uses the `src` attribute to link a `.js` file.

### ‚ùì Question 1
> Which type of JavaScript integration places the code directly within the HTML document?
#### üß™ Process
Directly in the HTML document would be `internal`

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `internal` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 2
> Which method is better for reusing JS across multiple web pages?
#### üß™ Process
If using across multiple pages then surly `external`.

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `external` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 3
> What is the name of the external JS file that is being called by **external_test.html**?
#### üß™ Process
I had to actually look at the exercise files on the desktop. Turns out there is a file called `thme_external.js`.

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `thm_external.js` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 4
> What attribute links an external JS file in the `<script>` tag?
#### üß™ Process
To include an external script you would use `<script src=...>` so lets assume that we just want `src` as our answer. 

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `src` ‚úÖ


## üìòAbusing Dialogue Functions
### Dialogue Functions & Malicious Use
- JavaScript enables **user interaction** through dialogue boxes using built-in functions like `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()`.
- These functions enhance interactivity but can also be **abused by attackers** if not handled securely.

#### `alert()`
- Displays a simple message with an **‚ÄúOK‚Äù** button.
- Often used for alerts or notifications.
**Example:**
```javascript
alert("Hello THM");
```
- Executing this in the Chrome Console shows a pop-up with the message.
	![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614103314.png)
#### `prompt()`
- Asks the user for input and returns the value.
- Returns `null` if the user clicks **Cancel**.

**Example:**
```javascript
name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello " + name);
```
- Prompts the user for their name and then greets them in a second dialog.
	![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614103443.png)
	![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614103619.png)
#### `confirm()`
- Displays a message with **‚ÄúOK‚Äù** and **‚ÄúCancel‚Äù** buttons.
- Returns `true` if the user clicks OK, `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
```javascript
confirm("Do you want to proceed?");
```
- Use it to get confirmation from the user before proceeding with actions.
	![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614103718.png)

#### Malicious Use Example
- An attacker could send you an HTML file with embedded JavaScript that runs as soon as the page loads.
- These scripts may annoy or trap users by repeatedly displaying dialogue boxes.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Hacked</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            alert("Hacked");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
- When opened, this script triggers 3 alert boxes in succession.
    
- Changing `i < 3` to `i < 500` would flood the user with alert pop-ups, making the browser unusable until all are dismissed.
- 1 / 3:
  ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614103914.png)
- 2 / 3:
  ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614104034.png)
- 3 / 3:
  ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614104037.png)
- Done:
  ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250614104049.png)

#### Key Takeaway
- These dialogue functions are **legitimate features** but can be **easily abused**.
- Always verify the **source** of any HTML or JavaScript file before opening it, especially if it's sent via email or comes from an unknown location.
- This example sets the stage for understanding **client-side attacks** like XSS in later tasks.

### ‚ùì Question 1
> In the file **invoice.html**, how many times does the code show the alert Hacked?
#### üß™ Process
I've learned my lesson on this one. Check the exercise files!

Viewing the code, because we wouldn't just want to blindly run any code. I can see the for loop is < 5. Because it starts at 0 there would be 5 increments (`0`, `1`,`2`,`3`, and `4`).

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `5` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 2
> Which of the JS interactive elements should be used to display a dialogue box that asks the user for input?
#### üß™ Process
This function is 'confirm'.

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `confirm` ‚ùå

Oops! No, too many letters. Prompt!
- `prompt` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question 3
> If the user enters Tesla, what value is stored in the carName= prompt("What is your car name?")? in the carName variable?
#### üß™ Process
I don't understand, if you enter `Testla` that is what is stored right?

Trying that as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `Tesla` ‚úÖ


## üìòBypassing Control Flow Statements
JavaScript like many programming languages uses control flow to determine the order in which instructions are executed. 

Control flow can be thought of as two behaviours: _Decisions_ and _Repetition_
- **Decisions**
	- `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- **Repetition**
	- `for`, `while`, `do...while`

### Conditional Statements in Action
The most common conditional statement is `if-else`. They allow execution based on a `true` or `false` result.

#### Example
Code example
```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	    <title>Age Verification</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	    <h1>Age Verification</h1>
	    <p id="message"></p>
	
	    <script>
	        age = prompt("What is your age")
	        if (age >= 18) {
	            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You are an adult.";
	        } else {
	            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You are a minor.";
	        }
	    </script>
	</body>
	</html>
```

**First run**
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616132010.png)

**Enter 69**
If you where to enter `69` as your input you would receive the confirmation that "You are an adult.". Congratulations. 
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616131541.png)

**Enter 16**
However, if you where to enter `16`, "You are a minor." You have your whole life ahead of you.
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616131712.png)

**Null value**
If for example you cancelled the _prompt_ you would have a null response. Null could be considered 0, 0 is less than 18, there for you would be a minor.
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616131828.png)

### Bypassing Login Forms
In this example we are given a pre-made file in the exercise folder called `login.html`. Shockingly, but not unseen, the credentials are 'hard-coded' in the html file. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Login Authentication</h2>

    <script>
        let username = prompt("Enter your username:");
        let password = prompt("Enter your password:");

        if (username === "admin" && password === "ComplexPassword") {
            document.write("You are successfully authenticated!");
        } else {
            document.write("Authentication failed. Incorrect username or password.");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

We can see from the code if the `username`/`password` is correct the text "You are successfully authenticated!" will be shown.
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616134146.png)

Otherwise you will see "Authentication failed. Incorrect username or password."
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616134200.png)

### ‚ùì Question
> What is the message displayed if you enter the age less than 18?
#### üß™ Process
Not much of a process. 
```javascript
if (age >= 18) {
	            // [redacted]
	        } else {
	            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "You are a minor.";
	        }
```
Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `You are a minor` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùì Question
> What is the password for the user admin?
#### üß™ Process
For this we can quickly look at the code above for the answer
```javascript
if (username === "admin" && password === "ComplexPassword"){
	//[redacted]
}
```
Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `ComplexPassword`‚úÖ


## üìòExploring Minified Files
**Minified** (minification) means to reduce the size of the Java Script by removing all unnecessary characters, such as _spaces_, _line breaks_, _comments_, _etc._

This is done to compact the file and improve loading times. however it is harder to read. It is important to note, the code remains functionally the same.

On the topic of making things harder to read, another technique is **obfuscation**, this changes code to an unreadable by changing function names, variables to random names. Sometimes dummy obsfuscated code is also inserted.

**Example - Original**
```javascript
function lemonaid(){
    alert("Hello World!")
}
```

**Example - Obfuscated**
Using the _[JavaScript Obfuscator](https://codebeautify.org/javascript-obfuscator)_ page on _[codebeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org)_ we can see the obfuscated code looks nothing like the original above.
```javascript
(function(_0xd05e8,_0x3c8510){var _0x1821e4=_0x3548,_0x419d7a=_0xd05e8();while(!![]){try{var _0x72f47c=parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x165))/(0x1*0x2213+0x35a+-0x256c)+-parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x15f))/(-0x23d9+-0x31+0x240c)+parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x167))/(0x801*-0x2+-0x714+-0x9*-0x291)*(parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x166))/(-0x13d6+-0x221b+-0x1*-0x35f5))+parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x162))/(-0x1757+0x173d+-0x1f*-0x1)*(parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x160))/(-0x43*0x6e+-0x1*-0x1352+0x6*0x195))+parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x164))/(-0xf6d*-0x1+-0x1d15+0xdaf)+parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x15d))/(-0x1598*0x1+-0xe17*-0x1+0x789)+-parseInt(_0x1821e4(0x161))/(-0x1dcb+0x237e+-0x1*0x5aa);if(_0x72f47c===_0x3c8510)break;else _0x419d7a['push'](_0x419d7a['shift']());}catch(_0x4e228e){_0x419d7a['push'](_0x419d7a['shift']());}}}(_0x148a,0x29b76+-0x9*-0x1217f+-0x1c380));function _0x3548(_0x4e9324,_0x4ff1fc){var _0x489c27=_0x148a();return _0x3548=function(_0x12d235,_0x2ca0ae){_0x12d235=_0x12d235-(-0x1462+-0x263*-0xd+0x129*-0x8);var _0x102866=_0x489c27[_0x12d235];return _0x102866;},_0x3548(_0x4e9324,_0x4ff1fc);}function lemonaid(){var _0x1b8d73=_0x3548,_0x1c57ae={'UCbka':function(_0x4b7d8a,_0x300096){return _0x4b7d8a(_0x300096);},'KuJmC':_0x1b8d73(0x15e)+'d!'};_0x1c57ae[_0x1b8d73(0x163)](alert,_0x1c57ae[_0x1b8d73(0x168)]);}function _0x148a(){var _0x4456cc=['Hello\x20Worl','980242uLTZQZ','1524voFQSf','25667190zZShbR','21940wSHmCn','UCbka','1904455kAVUVH','1443525ThvTpN','753388Egidzk','15HkXdjN','KuJmC','2339512YEqKIk'];_0x148a=function(){return _0x4456cc;};return _0x148a();}
```

After updating the files in the exercise directory on the THM box we can see that the page renders fine, but the code is obfuscated:
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616152712.png)


### Deobfuscating Code
The room recommends the [Obfuscator.io Deobfuscator](https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/) website to obfuscate the code.

The process is very much the same as obfsucating the code. 
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616153407.png)




### ‚ùì Question 1
> What is the alert message shown after running the file **hello.html**?
#### üß™ Process
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250616153500.png)

As you load the page the answer is provided, also in the deobfuscated code above.

Trying this as the answer

#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `Welcome to THM`

### ‚ùì Question 2
> What is the value of the **age** variable in the following obfuscated code snippet?

#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `21`


## üìòBest Practices
### No client side validation
Client-side validation is a primary function of Java Script

Some developers have used Java Script to validate form input.

Since a user can manipulate their environment, this is bad practice. The user could disable validation or manipulate it to accept dangerous inputs.

### Prefer trusted libraries
As previously mentioned, you can include external JavaScript files using the `<script src>` tag. It‚Äôs important to verify the trustworthiness of any external library you use. Attackers may upload fake libraries with names similar to legitimate ones. Including these untrusted libraries could expose your web application to malicious code.

### No hardcoded secrets
**You should never hardcode sensitive data in the JavaScript code**. Again, the user has entire control of their own environment. Meaning sensitive data is exposed.

**Sensitive data means**
- API Keys
- access tokens
- credentials 
- server specific data

**Example**:
```javascript
const privateAPIKey = "pk_TryNotToHackMe_1337"
```

### Minify and Obfuscate code
Reducing the file size (Minifying) and making the script harder to understand (obfuscating) will make it harder for attackers to understand.

Whilst the obfuscation can be reversed it will at least slow the attacker down.

### ‚ùì Question
> Is it a good practice to blindly include JS in your code from any source (yea/nay)?
#### üß™ Process
> Including these untrusted libraries could expose your web application to malicious code

Trying this as the answer
#### ‚úÖ Answer
- `nay`


## üìòConclusion
We‚Äôve covered the fundamentals such as writing JavaScript, integrating it into HTML, and creating basic programs.

We then explored user interaction like alert, prompt, and confirm, and how these can be abused by attackers.

We looked at control flow (decisions and repetition), and how some of these behaviours can be bypassed.

We also touched on minifying and obfuscating code, both to improve performance and to make it harder for attackers to understand your logic.

To wrap up, we learned some simple but important best practices to help keep your web apps safe.
