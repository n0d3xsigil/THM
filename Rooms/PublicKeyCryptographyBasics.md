## Introduction
### Real-Life Analogy for Cybersecurity Concepts
Using a casual meeting with a business partner, the text introduces four core cybersecurity principles:
- **Authentication**: Confirming the identity of the person you're communicating with.
- **Authenticity**: Verifying the message truly comes from the claimed sender.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring the message hasn't been tampered with.
- **Confidentiality**: Keeping the communication private from unauthorized access.
### How Cryptography Supports These Principles
- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Primarily ensures confidentiality.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Supports authentication, authenticity, and integrity.
### Learning Focus: Public Key Cryptography
This module introduces key tools and systems used in public key cryptography:
- **RSA**
- **Diffie-Hellman**
- **SSH**
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**
- **PGP** and **GPG**

It is the second module in a three-part series:
