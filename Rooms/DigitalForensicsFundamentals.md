## 📘Introduction to Digital Forensics
Forensics that fall in the remit of cyber crimes would be **Digital Forensics**. The scope of _cyber crime_ is any criminal activity conducted on or by using a digital device There are lots of tools, techniques, and procedures can be employed to analyse and document evidence in case of legal action.


Whilst digital devices solve many problems, global communication is now just a matter of message or call. Digital devices have made our lives more convenient, not just for the well meaning individual but also cyber criminals.

Consider a scenario. Michael robbed a bank. The police have _reasonable grounds_ to perform a search of the premises.

Multiple digital devices are seized including a **Laptop Computer**, a **Mobile Phone**, an **External Hard Drive**, and a **USB** flash drive.

These digital devices where referred to the **Digital Forensics Unit** for examination. The team followed the **chain of custody** procedures to ensure **Integrity** of the evidence.

All devices where imaged by a **secure forensics laboratory** using specific **digital forensics tools** which resulted in the following **digital evidence** being obtained:
- A **digitised map** of the targeted bank found on the suspects laptop, showing **pre-meditated** actions
- **Entry** and **exit** strategy for the targeted bank showing **escape planning**
- **physical security measures** of the targeted bank showing specifics of physical security and how to **circumvent the controls**
- Also found on the suspects laptop where **multimedia files** including photos and videos of **previous robberies** suspected to be linked based on file metadata and visual similarities
- Forensic analysis of the mobile phone found encrypted messages and calls linked to co-conspirators which included conversations linked to the robbery.  


### ❓ Question
> Which team was handed the case by law enforcement?
#### 🧪 Process
The case was forwarded to the `digital forensics` team.

#### ✅ Answer
- `digital forensics` ✅

## 📘Digital Forensics Methodology
Lets go over the forensics methodology now, this section focuses on the **NIST** (National Institute for Standards and Technology) prescribed framework which is broken down in four phases.

### Collection
This is the first phase for digital forensics, we ant to identify all the devices that can be collected and may contain data such as Computers, Cameras, USBs etc. 

We need to ensure that the original data is not tampered with during the collection of evidence and maintain proper documentation of all the items collected into evidence. 

### Examination
The next phase is examination. The shear amount of data collected could quite easily overwhelm investigators so the data will often be filtered to just the relevant data.

As an example,  an investigator may have collected data from an external hard drive from the criminals bedroom, only some of this data will be relevant.

In the examination phase you would only record the files that where relevant and move on to the next phase. 

### Analysis
This phase is critical. It is now when the data will be analysed by investigators and potentially link with other pieces of evidence to build a better picture or case. 

### Reporting
The final phase in digital forensics is the reporting of what was done. The report is to be detailed and contain the methodology and detailed findings.

It may contain recommendations for management or law enforcement. 

An executive summary is an important inclusion to the report to ensure understanding for all parties.


### Computer Forensics
It's important to note that there are different tools and techniques for digital forensics depending on the type of equipment being investigated.

#### Computer forensics
Computer forensics, the most common devices used in crime.

#### Mobile forensics
Mobile forensics could include **call records**, **messages**, **location data**, etc.

#### Network forensics
Network forensics could include the entire network, however could be focused on traffic logs

#### Database forensics
Databases can contain a huge amount of data, database forensics focuses on intrusion, manipulation, and exfiltration of data.
#### Cloud forensics
Cloud forensics can be difficult for investigators, it focuses on data stored on cloud infrastructure, often little evidence is stored.

#### Email forensics
Email forensics focuses on the email systems and investigating potential crimes.


### ❓ Question
> Which phase of digital forensics is concerned with correlating the collected data to draw any conclusions from it?
#### 🧪 Process
This is a apart of the analysis process.

#### ✅ Answer
- `Analysis` ✅

### ❓ Question
> Which phase of digital forensics is concerned with extracting the data of interest from the collected evidence?
#### 🧪 Process
We would want to extract the data in order to examine it.

#### ✅ Answer
- `Examination` ✅
