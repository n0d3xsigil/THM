## 📘Introduction

The Cyber Kill Chain©️ framework, deveopled by Lockheed Martin in 2011 based on the millitary concept.

In order for an adversary to suceed in defeating the defenses they will need to beat every phase of the Kill Chain.

Any _SOC Analyst_, _Security Researcher_, _Threat Hunter_ or _Incident Responder_ should have a good undertanding of the Kill Chain in order to recognise an intrusion.



## 📘Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the process of discovering and collecting information on a subject. Such as a system, victim, target etc. Think of it as the planning phase.

**OSINT** can be considered Reconnaissance, OSINT is Open Source Intelligence. With OSINT we can find information about people, businesses etc with just information publically available. 


**Email harvesting** is sourcing emails from services, may that be public, paid or free services. These addresses are then used for email harvesting for phishing attacks.

#### ✅ Answer

- `Email Harvesting` ✅



## 📘Weaponization

- After initial reconnaissance, the attacker enters the **weaponization phase**.
- The goal is to prepare a **malicious payload** that exploits system vulnerabilities.
- Instead of developing custom malware, the attacker may **purchase pre-made payloads** from underground sources to save time.
- Common weaponization methods include:
  - Embedding malware and exploits into **infected documents** (e.g., with malicious macros or scripts).
  - Distributing **USB drives** containing worms or other malicious code.
- The attacker also selects:
  - Command and Control (**C2**) techniques to remotely execute commands or deliver additional payloads.
  - **Backdoor implants** to maintain unauthorized access to the target system.

### ❓ Question

> This term is referred to as a group of commands that perform a specific task. You can think of them as subroutines or functions that contain the code that most users use to automate routine tasks. But malicious actors tend to use them for malicious purposes and include them in Microsoft Office documents. Can you provide the term for it?

#### 🧪 Process

I use these every day to automate processes in documents. Usually Excel and I would call it a VBA `Macro`.

#### ✅ Answer

- `Macro` ✅



## 📘Delivery

- **Phishing Emails**
  - Crafted to appear legitimate and target specific individuals (spearphishing) or broader groups.
  - May impersonate trusted contacts and include malicious attachments or links.
  - Example tactic: mimicking a known contact’s email to send a fake invoice containing malware.
- **Infected USB Drives**
  - Left in public places (e.g., coffee shops, parking lots) or mailed to targets.
  - May be branded with company logos to appear trustworthy.
  - Once plugged in, the USB executes the malicious payload.
- **Watering Hole Attacks**
  - The attacker compromises a website frequently visited by the target group.
  - Victims are redirected to a malicious site or prompted to download malware.
  - Often involves exploiting known website vulnerabilities.
  - May include drive-by downloads, such as fake browser extension pop-ups.


### ❓ Question

> What is the name of the attack when it is performed against a specific group of people, and the attacker seeks to infect the website that the mentioned group of people is constantly visiting.

#### 🧪 Process

This is a `Watering Hole Attack`.
