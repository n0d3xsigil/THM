## 📘Introduction

The Cyber Kill Chain©️ framework, deveopled by Lockheed Martin in 2011 based on the millitary concept.

In order for an adversary to suceed in defeating the defenses they will need to beat every phase of the Kill Chain.

Any _SOC Analyst_, _Security Researcher_, _Threat Hunter_ or _Incident Responder_ should have a good undertanding of the Kill Chain in order to recognise an intrusion.



## 📘Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the process of discovering and collecting information on a subject. Such as a system, victim, target etc. Think of it as the planning phase.

**OSINT** can be considered Reconnaissance, OSINT is Open Source Intelligence. With OSINT we can find information about people, businesses etc with just information publically available.
