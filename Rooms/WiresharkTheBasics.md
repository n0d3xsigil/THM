## Introduction
Wireshark is an open source and cross platform packet analyser that can be used to capture live network for analysis. Often the goto tool for package analysis. 

From a personal perspective, I have used wireshark a few times but I have never gotten the true value out of it. Hopfully this basics will help.

There are two questions in this intoduction

> **Question 1**: _Which file is used to **simulate** the screenshots_

Process - The text above states _You can use the `"http1.pcapng"` file to simulate the actios shown in the **screenshots**_ so this will be the answer to question 1.

- **Answer 1**: `http1.pcapng` ✅

> **Question 2**: _Which file is use to **answer** the questions?_

Process - The text above states _Please note that you need to use the `"Exercise.pcapng"` file to answe the questions._, so this will be the answer to question 2.

- **Answer 2**: `Exercise.pcapng` ✅
