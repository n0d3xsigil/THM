### Calculating the Financial Impact of Training

Let’s talk numbers! To calculate the financial impact of training, we will consider the following case:

- **Situation**: A cyber security team has ten employees
- **Cost**: Each employee costs $80,000 annually
- **Assumption**: Training increases productivity by 4%

Knowing that one employee costs $80,000 annually and that we have ten employees, then the savings (gains) due to the training of ten employees are $32,000 (10 × 4% × $80,000).

Assuming that the cost of training is $500 per employee, the total cost is $5,000 (10 × $500 = $5,000).

It is easy now to show that the Return On Investment (ROI) is 640% ($32,000/$5,000 = 640%).


### Consider the following scenario and answer the following questions.

- **Situation**: A cyber security team has 20 employees
- **Cost**: Each employee costs $50,000 annually
- **Assumption**: Training increases productivity by 4%


### ❓ Question 1

> What would be the savings due to the increased productivity?

#### 🧪 Process

$50,000 * 20 employees = $1,000,000 / 100 = $10,000 * 4 = $40,000.

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `40000` ✅


### ❓ Question 2

> Assuming that training costs $500 per employee, what is the Return on Investment?

#### 🧪 Process

$40,000 / $10,000 = 4

4 * 100 = 400%

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `400%` ✅
