## Introduction

YARA the pattern recognition tool to aid security personnel analyse potential malware and categorise within a specific rulesets



## What is Yara?

YARA standing for _**Y**et **A**nother **R**idiculous **A**cronym_ is _"The pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)"_.

YARA is a tool that will perform pattern matching against a particular rule.

_**Example rule:**_
```yara
rule Hello_World
{
    meta:
        description = "Flags any sign of the world famous 'Hello World'"
        author = "n0d3xsigil"
    strings:
        $s1 = "Hello World"
        $s2 = "Hello_World"
        $s3 = "HelloWorld"
        $hex1 = { 4D 5A 90 00 }
    condition:
        $s1 or $s2 or $s3 and $hex1
}
```

- **YARA** is a pattern-matching tool widely used in **malware research**, capable of identifying binary and textual patterns (e.g. hex, strings) in files.
- **YARA rules** are used to detect threats by defining specific patterns (features) found in malicious files.
- **Strings** are a core part of programming, used to store text — malware also uses them to store critical data.
- Examples of string data in malware:
  - **Ransomware**: Bitcoin wallet addresses (e.g. `12t9YDPg...`)
  - **Botnets**: Command & Control (C\&C) server IPs (e.g. `12.34.56.7`)
  - You could write a YARA rule to find programs containing a specific string like `"hello world"` across your system.

### ❓ Question 1

> What is the name of the base-16 numbering system that Yara can detect?

#### 🧪 Process

`hexadecimal` is 16-bit (0123456789ABCDEF).

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer 1

- `hexadecimal` ✅


### ❓ Question 2

> Would the text "Enter your Name" be a string in an application? (Yay/Nay)

#### 🧪 Process

Any text would be a string so `Yay`.

Trying this as as the answer


#### ✅ Answer

- `Yay` ✅
