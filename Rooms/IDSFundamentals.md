## 📘What Is an IDS

An IDS is different in from a firewall in that a firewall will deny traffic if it doesnt meet specific criteria. But what if you have port 80 open. Well any traffic that is using port 80 can slip through the net.

Instead, an IDS will monitor this activity and report on it. Rather than preventing (IPS) the intrusion, it detects and reports it.
