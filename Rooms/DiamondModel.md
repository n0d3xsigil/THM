# Diamond Model

## Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)



## ðŸ“˜Introduction

**Origin**
- Developed in 2013 by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz.
- See [`diamond.pdf`](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf) for the full documentation.

**Core Components**
- The model consists of four main features
  - **Adversary** â€“ the threat actor behind the intrusion.
  - **Infrastructure** â€“ the systems and services used by the adversary.
  - **Capability** â€“ the tools and techniques used in the attack.
  - **Victim** â€“ the target of the intrusion.
- These four features are connected at the edges, forming a **diamond shape** to represent their interrelationships.

**Additional Axes**
- Two more contextual dimensions are mentioned
  - **Social-Political**
  - **Technology**

**Purpose and Flexibility**
- Designed to encapsulate key concepts of intrusion analysis and adversary behavior.
- Flexible enough to incorporate new ideas and evolving threats.

**Practical Applications**
- Enables real-time intelligence integration for network defense.
- Supports
  - Automated event correlation.
  - Confident classification of events into adversary campaigns.
  - Forecasting of adversary operations.
  - Planning and simulating mitigation strategies.

**Why Learn It?**
- Helps identify and analyze elements of a cyber intrusion.
- Assists in creating a Diamond Model for incidents like breaches or attacks.
- Useful for analyzing **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**.
- Aids in explaining incidents to **non-technical audiences**.
