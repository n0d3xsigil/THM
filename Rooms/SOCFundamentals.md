### Detection
**Detect Vulnerabilities**
- Vulnerabilities may occur in OS, Software, Firmware. On PC's, Servers, Printers etc. The SOC will scan for vulnerabilities and report on mitigation progress, perhaps get involved should vulnerabilities not be patched.
**Detect unauthorised activity**
- Identify unauthorised activity such as log-ins, downloads, application usage etc. using hints such as geographic usage may help.
**Detect policy violations**
- Policies are put in place to protect the environment. Policy violations may include unauthorised software downloads, sharing user credentials, uploading sensitive company information
**Detect intrusion**
- An intrusion is an unauthorised access of the organisation resources. Maybe it may be a mis-configuration, or a exploited vulnerability.
### Response
**Support with the incident response**
- A process is followed should an incident be detected. The primary objective is to minimise impact and root cause analysis. 
- The SOC will also support the Incident Response Team
