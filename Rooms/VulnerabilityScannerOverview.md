## 📘What Are Vulnerabilities?

Vulnerability, a weakness in something. Maybe a mug has a hairline crack. Been there for years and one day you have a hot cup of tea down you. The cup was compromised.

A vulnerability is a weakness in the security of a system, many vulnerabilties are low risk, however a low risk could become a critical if found exploitable. 

It is our responsibilities to ensure we patch these vulnerabiltiies as soon as possible to reduce the risk to the environment.


### ❓ Question

> What is the process of fixing the vulnerabilities called?

#### 🧪 Process

I've always used the name `Remediation` for fixing vulnerabilities. 

Oh, now I have started reading the intro, I can see we're supposed to use `Patching`. 😄

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `Patching` ✅



## 📘Vulnerability Scanning

When performing a vulnerability scan we are essentially looking at all the potentially open ports on a machine then trying to identify if any services that are linked to those open ports are suseptable to a vulnerability. 

Scanning a host once is not enough, we need to reglarly scan every device on the network regulalry to ensure compliance. New software or services could be installed or even new vulnerabilities discovered for an existing service.

When it comes to scanning there are two types **Authenticated** and **Unauthenticated** scans, below we see a comparison

|                       Authenticated                        |                       Unauthenticated                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| An authenticated account must be used                      | Has no internal access, must be scanned Externally (via IP) |
| Identifies vunerabilities exploitable with physical access | Identifies vulnerabilities exploitable via the network      |
| Greater visibility of installed config and installed apps  | Less invasive and simpler to implement                      |
| **Example**: Scan internal DB with credentials             | **Example**: Scan website for exploits                      |


And what about the location of the scan taking place. Well, we have **internal** and **external** scans. Again, some key points below

|    Internal                                                |    External                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scans from within the network                              | Scans external to the network                               |
| Focuses on exploits within the network                     | Focuses on external exploits                                |
| Useful for discovering potential pivot exploits            | Identifies attack vectors                                   |


### ❓ Question 1

> Which type of vulnerability scans require the credentials of the target host?

#### 🧪 Process

We would want the credentials of a host in order to perform an _internal_ _`authenticated`_ scan.

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `authenticated` ✅


### ❓ Question 2

> Which type of vulnerability scan focuses on identifying the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network?

#### 🧪 Process

Outside == `External`

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `External` ✅



## 📘Tools for Vulnerability Scanning

There are lots of scanners out there, lets take a look at some of the common ones

### Nessus

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff221b72-f131-4673-be99-ba39bd1146c0)

Originally open source back in '98 it was qxquired by Tenable in 2005 when it was changed to proprietary software. Widely used by large org's. Has extensive scanning apability. A free version exists but is very limited in capabilty compared to the commercial versions.

### Qualys

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef8db6c-2c62-4a1c-91fb-a244d5c53d42)

Developed in '99 as a subscription based VMS. In addition to continuious scanning it also has asset management and compliance checks. Also cloud based which is a bonus for infrastrucutre.


### Nexpose

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b1d1756-9359-452e-80ed-3e66e0f9a69d)

Developed by _Rapid7_ in '05. Also subscription based, and performns continious scanning. Provides rislk scores based on asset value and impact.  Both on prem and cloud deployment.


### OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d69b491-7f92-4796-84c1-8a5980f493f9)

Another Open-Source VAS. Detail reports, all vulns discovered and scores. 

### ❓ Question 1

> Is Nessus currently an open-source vulnerability scanner? (Yea/Nay)

#### 🧪 Process

`Nay`, it was reclassified as a proprietary software back in 2005

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `Nay` ✅


### ❓ Question 2

> Which company developed the Nexpose vulnerability scanner?

#### 🧪 Process

Nexpose was developed by _`Rapid7`_.

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `Rapid7` ✅


### ❓ Question 3

> What is the name of the open-source vulnerability scanner developed by Greenbone Security?

#### 🧪 Process

Greenbone ovvers the `OpenVAS`

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `OpenVAS` ✅



## 📘CVE & CVSS

### CVE

CVE stands for **Common Vulnerabilties and exposures**, it is like a ticket. The MITRE Corporation created the framework to record the progress of vulnerabilities.

The CVE number has the following structure.

`CVE - YYYY - ####`

The CVE prefix just tells you it is a CVE, it is instantly recognisable. The year represents the year of discovery, whilst the remaining digits represnet the sequence in sequential order.


### CVSS

The CVSS stands for **Common Vulnerabilitiy Scoring System**

| CVSS Score (Range)  | Severity Levels |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 0.0 -  3.9          | Low             |
| 4.0 -  6.9          | Medium          |
| 7.0 -  8.9          | High            |
| 9.0 - 10.0          | Critical        |



### ❓ Question 1

> CVE stands for?

#### 🧪 Process

Oh, oh, oh, I know this `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures`.

Trying this as the answer

#### ✅ Answer

- `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures` ✅


### ❓ Question 2

> Which organization developed CVE?

#### 🧪 Process

### ❓ Question 3

> What would be the severity level of the vulnerability with a score of 5.3?

#### 🧪 Process
