## 📘Introduction


## 📘What is a "Kill Chain"

- The term **"Kill Chain"** comes from the military and outlines the steps of an attack.
- In cybersecurity, it maps how attackers (e.g. hackers, APTs) approach and breach a target.
- Example steps: **scanning → exploiting → privilege escalation**.
- The goal is to **understand the attack process** to
  - Strengthen defences ahead of time.
  - Detect and **disrupt the attacker** during the intrusion.
- The **Unified Kill Chain** expands on this concept to cover full campaign-level activity.

  ## 📘What is "Threat Modelling"

- **Threat modelling** is a structured process to identify and reduce risks in systems or applications.
- Key steps include
  - Identifying **critical systems/assets** and their roles (e.g. store sensitive data or support operations).
  - Assessing **vulnerabilities** and how they could be exploited.
  - Developing an **action plan** to secure those systems.
  - Implementing **preventive measures** (e.g. secure development practices, staff training)
- It provides a **high-level view of IT assets** and outlines how to resolve weaknesses.
- The **Unified Kill Chain supports threat modelling** by highlighting likely attack paths and exploitable surfaces.
- Common threat modelling frameworks: **STRIDE**, **DREAD**, **CVSS**.
