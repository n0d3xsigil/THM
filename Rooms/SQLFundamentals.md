## Introduction
Databases, the bread and butter of applications the world over. It doesn't matter if it is a HR system, Web application, file scanner, SOC, or any other data driven tool, You will be using a database.

On the offensive side understanding databases can help us with SQL vulnerabilities such as SQL injections which can help us craft queries that will tamper or retrieve data or on the defensive side understanding how to navigate databases to find suspicious activity or implement a more secure database.

What ever the side of the fence you find yourself on, it is essential to know about and understand databases and the most common form, SQL (Structured Query Language).

No Microsoft Access here ;)
