## Introduction
### Why Use Hashing?
When you download or receive a large file (e.g., 6 GB), you want to ensure it‚Äôs **identical to the original**. The best way to do this is by comparing hash values.
### What Is a Hash Value?
- A **hash value** is a fixed-length string generated by a hash function.
- The function takes input of any size and produces a consistent-length output.
- If two files have the same hash, they are almost certainly identical.

> ‚ÄúHash‚Äù can refer to the function, the value, or the act of computing it.

### Room Context
This is the third room in the cryptography series:
- **Cryptography Basics**
- **Public Key Cryptography Basics**
- **Hashing Basics** (this room)
### Learning Objectives
By the end of this room, you‚Äôll understand:
- How **hash** functions work and what **collisions** are
- How hashing is used in **authentication systems**
- How to **recognize and crack** stored hash values
- How hashing ensures **data integrity**


## Hash Functions
### What Is a Hash Function?
- A **hash function** takes input data of any size and produces a **fixed-size output** (called a hash or digest).
- It is **not encryption**: there is no key, and it‚Äôs designed to be **one-way**‚Äîyou can‚Äôt reverse it to get the original input.
- A **good hash function** is:
  - Fast to compute
  - Hard to reverse
  - Sensitive to input changes (even 1 bit changes the output drastically)
### üß™ Example: One-Bit Difference
- File 1 contains the letter **T** (`0x54` or `01010100`)
- File 2 contains the letter **U** (`0x55` or `01010101`)
- Despite differing by just **1 bit**, their hashes are completely different:

```bash
md5sum file1.txt  # b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3
md5sum file2.txt  # 4c614360da93c0a041b22e537de151eb

sha1sum file1.txt # c2c53d66948214258a26ca9ca845d7ac0c17f8e7
sha1sum file2.txt # b2c7c0caa10a0cca5ea7d69e54018ae0c0389dd6

sha256sum file1.txt # e632b7095b0bf32c260fa4c539e9fd7b852d0de454e9be26f24d0d6f91d069d3
sha256sum file2.txt # a25513c7e0f6eaa80a3337ee18081b9e2ed09e00af8531c8f7bb2542764027e7
```

- Hash outputs are typically encoded in **hexadecimal** or **base64**.

### Why Is Hashing Important?
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures files haven‚Äôt been altered.
- **Password Security**: Systems store **hashes** of passwords, not the passwords themselves.
- Used in **login systems**, **file verification**, and **digital signatures**.
### What Is a Hash Collision?
- A **collision** occurs when two different inputs produce the **same hash**.
- Due to the **pigeonhole principle**, collisions are inevitable‚Äîbut good hash functions make them **extremely rare** and **hard to engineer**.
#### üß† Pigeonhole Principle
If a hash function outputs 4-bit values, there are only 16 possible hashes. If you hash 21 different inputs, at least two must share a hash.
### Insecure Hash Functions
- **MD5** and **SHA1** are no longer secure due to known collision attacks.
- Examples:
  - MD5 Collision Demo
  - SHA1 Collision (SHAttered)

> üîí Use modern algorithms like **SHA-256** or **SHA-3** for secure applications.

### Question 1 - What is the SHA256 hash of the `passport.jpg` file in `~/Hashing-Basics/Task-2`?
#### Process
Run `sha256sum` against the `passport.jpg` file to get the hash.
```Shell
user@ip-10-10-253-143:~$ cd Hashing-Basics/Task-2
user@ip-10-10-253-143:~/Hashing-Basics/Task-2$ sha256sum passport.jpg 
77148c6f605a8df855f2b764bcc3be749d7db814f5f79134d2aa539a64b61f02  passport.jpg
user@ip-10-10-253-143:~/Hashing-Basics/Task-2$ 
```

Trying this as the answer
#### Answer 1
- `77148c6f605a8df855f2b764bcc3be749d7db814f5f79134d2aa539a64b61f02` ‚úÖ
### Question 2 - What is the output size in bytes of the MD5 hash function?
#### Process
The MD5 has outputs a 16-bit hash. 

Trying this as the answer
#### Answer 2
- `16` ‚úÖ
### Question 3 - If you have an 8-bit hash output, how many possible hash values are there?
#### Process
As per the summary you would make `8` the power of `2` so it would become $\text{2}^\text{8}\text{ = 256}$

Trying this as the answer
#### Answer 3
- `256` ‚úÖ


## Using Hashing for Secure Password Storage
### Hashing in Cyber Security: Password Storage & Data Integrity
Hashing plays a crucial role in cyber security, particularly in:
- **Password Storage** (for authentication)
- **Data Integrity**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This does **not** apply to password managers, which require password retrieval in plaintext. Authentication systems only need to verify knowledge of the password, not retrieve it.

### Insecure Password Storage Practices
Many data breaches stem from poor password storage methods. Here are three common insecure practices:
#### 1. Storing Passwords in Plaintext
- **Example**: RockYou data breach
- **Impact**: Over 14 million plaintext passwords leaked
- **Tool**: `rockyou.txt` is now a common wordlist in Kali Linux
- **Location**: `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

```Shell
wc -l rockyou.txt
# 14344392 rockyou.txt

head rockyou.txt
# 123456
# 12345
# 123456789
# password
# iloveyou
# ...
```

#### 2. Using Deprecated Encryption
- **Example**: Adobe breach
- **Issue**: Used outdated encryption instead of hashing
- **Additional Risk**: Password hints stored in plaintext, often revealing the password
#### 3. Using Insecure Hashing Algorithms
- **Example**: LinkedIn breach (2012)
- **Issue**: Used SHA-1 without salting
- **Why it's bad**: SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks; lack of salting makes hashes easier to crack
### What is Salting?
**Salting** is the process of adding a random value to a password before hashing it. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
### Key Takeaways
- Never store passwords in plaintext.
- Avoid deprecated encryption methods.
- Use strong, modern hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salting.

### Question 1 - 
#### Process
We can grap the list using `head`. See the process below.
```Shell
user@ip-10-10-253-143:~/Hashing-Basics/Task-2$ head -n20 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
123456
12345
123456789
password
iloveyou
princess
1234567
rockyou
12345678
abc123
nicole
daniel
babygirl
monkey
lovely
jessica
654321
michael
ashley
qwerty
```

Since we issued the `-n20` argument we know there are 20 lines or results. The last entry in the list is `qwerty`.

#### Answer 1
- `qwerty` ‚úÖ
